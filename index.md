### About me
I am a PhD Student at the University of Goettingen working on Graph Convolutional Networks and Spatial Statistics. Previously I was an AI Resident at
Google Accra and a research Intern at DeepMind. I hold a Master in Machine Learning from AMMI Rwanda, a Master in Mathematical Sciences from AIMS Cameroon,
and a Master in Physics from the University of Yaounde I. I am both passionated about theoretical foundations of Machine Learning (its explainability, its robustness) and [Nonlinear Optics](https://opg.optica.org/josab/abstract.cfm?uri=josab-37-11-a331). Co-lead of Bel's AI Initiative, I am part of the WIMLDS Yaounde chapter, and member of KMERAI.
