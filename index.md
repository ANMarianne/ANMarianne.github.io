I am in the process of becoming a researcher in Machine Learning. Because of my prior background in Physics, I am motivated abut Quantum Machine Learning. But I am very excited about image captioning, still trying som mini project on that field. I am undertaking a Master in Machine Learning in Kigali. Looking forward for the end for the program and joping to go for an internship. 

I am passionate by Machine Learning. So far I enjoyed Statistical Machine Learning with Marc Peter Deisenroth, Deep Learning with Francois Fleuret, Alfredo Canzieni and Ritchie Ng, and Reinforcement Learning with Joelle Pineau and Benjamin Rosman.
