   Looking forward to becoming a talented researcher in Machine Learning. Because of my prior background in Physics, I am motivated about Quantum Machine Learning. But I am very excited about image captioning, still trying some mini projects on that field. I am undertaking a Master in Machine Learning in Kigali. My best wishes for the end of the program: going for an internship. 

   I am passionate by Machine Learning. So far I enjoyed [*Statistical Machine Learning*](https://github.com/ANMarianne/Statistical-Machine-learning) with Marc Peter Deisenroth, [*Deep Learning*](https://github.com/ANMarianne/Deep-Learning) with Francois Fleuret, Alfredo Canzieni and Ritchie Ng, and [*Reinforcement Learning*](https://github.com/ANMarianne/Reinforcement-Learning) with Joelle Pineau and Benjamin Rosman.
